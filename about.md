Hello! I'm a senior at Mercer Island High School who's interested in studying computer science. I took AP Computer Science in ninth grade and have continued to code ever since. 

In my free time, I enjoy building apps, websites, and all sorts of other programs. A full list of my projects can be seen [here](/projects). I also interned at the University of Washington and Expedia over the summers. 

In January of 2017, I co-founded TeamsCode, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that promotes interest and activity in computer science among high school students. To learn more, visit [teamscode.com](https://teamscode.com).

Outside of CS, I like to play table tennis and violin, as well as watch shows on Netflix or YouTube. If you want to get in touch, you can email me at [alan.bi326@gmail.com](alan.bi326@gmail.com) or use one of the contact buttons in the bottom right corner. &#x2198;
