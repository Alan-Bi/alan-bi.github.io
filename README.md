Source code for my personal website, built using React. 


### Development

On the `develop` branch, use `npm start` to run the code locally.

To deploy changes to the actual website, use `npm run deploy`. 
This will create a production build that can be deployed by GitHub Pages 
(see [react-gh-pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) for more info).
