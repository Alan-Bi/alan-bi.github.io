Hello!

My name is Alan Bi, and I'm a senior at Mercer Island High School. I plan to major in computer science next year, and I've decided to start a blog to document my thoughts and experiences as I navigate the field. 

Here are some goals that I have for this blog: 

* Create a list of posts that I can look back on in the future
* Improve my writing skills
* Share advice with anyone who stumbles upon this
* Try something new 

Ideally, I'd like to blog on a consistent basis; whether that be once a week, two weeks, or even a month, I'm not yet sure. Who knows, maybe this will be my first and _last_ post ever. 

Anyways, this concludes my first blog post; hopefully I'll have my second one up in the next week or two.
