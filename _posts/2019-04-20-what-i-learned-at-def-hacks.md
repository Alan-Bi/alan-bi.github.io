On April 13, I attended the Def Hacks Seattle 2019 hackathon, hosted by my good friend [Chris Elliott](https://chrismelliott.com/). This was my second hackathon ever, the first being the Def Hacks Seattle hackathon back in 2017, during which Chris and I co-founded [TeamsCode](https://teamscode.com/). This time around, I was going in solo and wanted to make some progress on my upcoming project [Bidbar](https://www.getbidbar.com/). As such, my hackathon experience was a bit atypical; instead of competing and working on a new project, I was coming in with an existing project I wanted to make progress on (I knew I couldn't compete or present my project, since I already worked on it beforehand). In addition, I didn't stay the whole time; I came at about 11 am and left at 11 pm, so only half of the experience of the full hackathon. Nonetheless, I still learned a lot of things, which I'm going to share in this blog post. 

Chance to talk to others: didn't have team, had a project so I wasn't looking for team members, but I tried to go around and talk to people I didn't know to ask them about their projects and learn from them. 

Take breaks: even though the goal at hackathons is to crank something out after 24 hours of hard work, it's hard to focus for so long. I found myself getting easily distracted or unfocused after working for too long at a time, so I took periodic breaks where I just walked around, talked to friends, or something else. 

Make use of mentors: I unfortunately didn't follow this advice, but there were a lot of mentors at the event with industry experience meant to help the students (I'm not sure if this is the same at all hackathons though). I spent over an hour trying to get the getbidbar.com domain to point to bidbar.netlify.com. The fix turned out to be very simple (change the DNS nameservers from the parking servers to my provider's servers << FIX THIS EXPLANATION). Overall, I think the most important thing about hackathons is to learn and meet new people, and you have a great opportunity to do so with the help of these mentors. 

Eat (as) healthy (as possible): We had pizza for lunch and pizza for dinner, and there was an unlimited supply of chip bags. I felt very tempted to open bag after bag of chips, but I was already starting to feel queazy and stopped myself after two. Luckily, Def Hacks provided some fruits and salads, and I substituted chips with tangerines for my evening snack :)

Have fun: a lot of volunteers came from my school so we had a good time playing ping pong, watching the cup stacking competition, and more. 

I'm definitely new when it comes to hackathons, and both of my experiences were very different from what one would usually do at a hackathon. But these are just my two cents that I wanted to share. Hopefully prospective hackers out there will read this and feel more inclined about going to their first event; hackathons are truly less intimidating than they seem!
