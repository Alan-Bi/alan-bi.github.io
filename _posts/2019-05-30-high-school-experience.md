When I entered high school, I had a few goals I was adamant on completing: take all the hardest classes, get all As, and go to a good college. At the end of that first semester, I got an A- in my english class, feeling as if all was lost. 



Looking back, I'm almost glad that I got that A-. It's pretty obvious that my previous goals were naive; taking hard classes isn't always the best idea, not having a 4.0 doesn't make you a failure just as having a 4.0 doesn't guarantee you a spot at a good college, and going to a good college is not the end-all-be-all. And after getting that A-, I now was able to slowly shift my focus to more important things. 



Biggest of all was that I finally ventured into computer science on my own time to see if it was something I truly enjoyed. I had already taken AP Computer Science, and now anything more I learned would have to be done through self-teaching. Luckily, I found that I did enjoy it. Thus, my time moved from doing homework and studying for tests to creating apps and learning data structures, dedicating my efforts towards extracurricular activities that I was truly passionate about. 



That's not to say that I stop caring about school or thought that the classes weren't useful; in fact, it was far from that. I still did my best to complete homework assignments on time, study for my tests, and make a genuine effort to learn. While a common complaint about high school is the strict requirements on what subjects and classes you have to take, I'm actually grateful to have taken these classes, which I think has helped me become a more well-rounded individual. But gone were my days of checking my grades three times a day and calculating what score I need to get XX% in a class. 



By spending less time on trivial things, I could spend time on things that mattered. I learned how to code by building apps and websites. I learned how to think critically by practicing solving coding problems. I made new friends joining Computer Club. And I learned key organization, leadership, teamwork, and business skills as a co-founder of [TeamsCode](https://teamscode.com), something I could not have done sitting in a classroom. 



Things I'm grateful for, things I regret
