On February 18, I launched my first-ever product Statsify on Product Hunt. I was lucky enough to have Statsify featured within a few minutes of posting, which gave it a decent spike of traffic. This blog post talks about my experience throughout both the development process and launch. 

Before we get into the details, here are some basic numbers for those of you curious: 

* Upvotes on Product Hunt: 143
* Unique visitors within first week: 3186
* Chrome extension users within first week: 49

# Idea Formation

As a second semester senior in high school, I knew that I was at risk of contracting [senioritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Senioritis). To try and combat this, I decided to keep myself busy with random coding projects. 

I always wanted to learn web scraping, so I decided that I would play around with the Python [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/) and [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) libraries and see if I could come up with an idea for a full-fledged project along the way.
