In this day and age, so many people want to learn how to code without knowing where to start. People often find the syntax of programming languages to be intimidating; meanwhile, others try to jump straight to building crazy apps and websites without understanding the basics. While it's certainly a viable path to focus on a specific type of coding (such as HTML/CSS, data analysis) for people who simply need to use programming as a small part of their lives, this blog post will focus on learning the fundamentals of programming for those who want to pursue computer science further. 

First, let's start with the obvious example: taking a programming class. Many colleges offer an Intro to Programming class, and some high schools offer AP Computer Science or AP Computer Science Principles. If you take a programming class and have a decent teacher, chances are, you'll learn the fundamentals pretty well as long as you pay attention and don't cheat. Especially with the rising popularity of CS and the prevalence of code on the Internet, it's not uncommon to see people [cheating](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/us/computer-science-cheating.html) in their classes, but it goes without saying that you're setting yourself up for failure if you take this route. 

Of course, not everyone has the opportunity or is willing to take a programming class in person. An alternative to this is to take an online course. There are a plethora of programming courses offered by Coursera, edX, Codecademy, Udemy, and other MOOCs (massive open online course), which may be enough for your needs. I personally have not looked into any of the intro programming classes on these websites so I can't say much with authority; however, my general advice would be to supplement these courses with projects or learning on your own if the course does not assign any large programming assignments or delve into the nuances of certain programming concepts. Thus, you have a combination of passive and active learning.
