About a month ago, I wrote a blog post describing the internal resources used by [TeamsCode](https://teamscode.com/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that organizes biannual programming contests in Washington Oregon. Building off of this, I thought it'd be cool to share some of the tools I use on my own computer, at the very least so that I can look back on it in five years and see how things have changed. So without further ado, let's start with the apps in my dock:

There's a lot to break down here, but they can be roughly categorized into groups.

### Web Browsers and General Apps

As on all Macs, we start with the Finder icon. Following that, I have the [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) desktop app, which I use whenever I need to check some text for grammar/writing style. These days, I only ever really use it to spellcheck my blog posts (the next time I use it will be for this post). Following that is [Station](https://getstation.com/), which essentially allows you to access various web apps within a single app. I use this as a unified place to access my Gmail accounts, Trello boards, and Slack channels. Lastly are Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. I pretty much only use Chrome, but if a site is acting weird on Chrome, I'll often switch browsers to see if it's a browser-specific issue or a problem with the site. 

### Development Tools

First off, we have Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. I mainly used Visual studio for my C# apps, and use VSCode very frequently for HTML/CSS/JS projects (including for this website). IntelliJ and PyCharm are used for Java and Python projects, respectively, and I'm currently trying out WebStorm as an alternative to VSCode for my upcoming Node.js project [CodeJoust](https://www.codejoust.co/) (all the JetBrains tools are free as a student). Next is Unity, which isn't an IDE or text editor, but I use it in conjunction with Visual Studio to do game development. Sublime Text is useful to make quick edits to a file, and XCode is for publishing apps to the iOS app store, although I rarely use it to write code. And finally, I occasionally use Postman if I need to debug an API call. 

### Microsoft Office

This group is pretty self-explanatory. All students at Mercer Island High School get access to Microsoft Office, so I have the luxury of downloading these apps on my computer. I mainly use Word and every now and then use OneNote, PowerPoint, and Excel. I'll probably start using Outlook more often once I enter college (my school email is provded through Outlook). Overall, MS Office combined with Google's apps (Gmail, Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc.) comprise most of my productivity tools. 

### Miscellaneous

![Misc. tool group](/assets/images/blog-images/2019/dock_misc.png)

The last group is mostly made up of the default macOS apps. I use Notes when I simply need to write something down and OneNote is too heavy-duty. Messages is linked with my phone number, so I can more easily respond to texts from my computer. I always have Terminal open with a tab for each of the projects I'm currently working on, making it quick and easy to run them locally, deal with version control, etc. The last two apps are Spotify and Preview. Spotify is pretty self-explanatory, and Preview actually isn't saved to my dock, but I use it frequently; right now, I have open a PDF book that I'm slowly working my way through. 

## Menu bar apps

In a later blog post, I might consider sharing my Chrome bookmarks, extensions, and other settings.
