About a month ago, I wrote a blog post describing the internal resources used by [TeamsCode](https://teamscode.com/), a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization that organizes biannual programming contests in Washington Oregon. Building off of this, I thought it'd be cool to share some of the tools I use on my own computer, at the very least so that I can look back on it in five years and see how things have changed. So without further ado, let's start with the apps in my dock:

There's a lot to break down here, but they can be roughly categorized into groups.

### Web Browsers and General Apps

As on all Macs, we start with the Finder icon. Following that, I have the [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) desktop app, which I use whenever I need to check some text for grammar/writing style. These days, I only ever really use it to spellcheck my blog posts (the next time I use it will be for this post). Following that is [Station](https://getstation.com/), which essentially allows you to access various web apps within a single app. I use this as a unified place to access my Gmail accounts, Trello boards, and Slack channels. Lastly are Safari, Firefox, and Chrome. I pretty much only use Chrome, but if a site is acting weird on Chrome, I'll often switch browsers to see if it's a browser-specific issue or a problem with the site. 

### Text Editors and IDEs



In a later blog post, I might consider sharing my Chrome bookmarks, extensions, and other settings.
