At the end of August, I flew from one coast of the US to the other, eager to begin college. The next few weeks passed by in a flurry of activity and excitement, and now, after about a month, things are finally beginning to settle down. From my _very limited_ experience of college life, I've compiled a personal list of takeaways and advice for adjusting to college life. 

**1. Talk to random people**

During orientation week, talk to as many people as you can. Although it can be scary, it's easy once you realize how little is at stake. Most people you meet during the first week won't actually be your true friends, so if things are awkward, just find someone else to talk to! 

In addition, if you get stuck for conversation, just fall back to a list of generic questions: What's your name? What's your major? Where are you from? What dorm are you in? Etc.

**2. Try out a lot of clubs**

I think freshman year of college is a good time to explore your interests, even if you already know your major. For example, the first few weeks, I attended info sessions and meetings for more clubs than I could realistically handle. Experimenting with a wide range of interests ultimately helped me get a better idea of what I like, and now, I'm only part of the clubs I truly enjoy and have the time for. 

**3. Make use of your school's resources**

Most schools offer a variety of services for students, such as academic advising, career help, and health/wellness. These services are usually free, so why not make the most of them? For example, if you're interested in working in industry, going to the career fair can be a good experience; while it'll be difficult to find an internship as a freshman, you'll at least get a feel for what it's like and get some free company swag! 

**4. Have free time to recharge**

**5. Have fun**
