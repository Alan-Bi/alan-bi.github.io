In a [previous blog post](/blog/2019-05-25/my-computer-desktop-arrangement/), I showed off some of the apps I found useful on my computer. Today, I'll be writing about the Chrome extensions that help me browse the web more productively.

### uBlock Origin

First up is an ad blocker, which is pretty self-explanatory. Of all the options, [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) is generally regarded as one of the best, which is why I chose them. 

### Google Translate

An extension I installed in high school when I was taking AP Spanish, [Google Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-translate/aapbdbdomjkkjkaonfhkkikfgjllcleb?hl=en) still has its uses here and there. When you see text in another language, you can simply highlight it, and the extension will translate it into your default language. Alternatively, you can click on the extension icon and manually type/paste text. And finally, if you stumble across a page that's written in another language, it can translate the entire page for you. 

### LastPass

I used to have the same password for all my accounts, but I finally gathered my senses and switched to a password manager; specifically, [LastPass](https://lastpass.com/). The useful thing about LastPass is that it can generate passwords for you and autofill your account details on every login page, thanks to the Chrome extension. Similarly, there's a mobile app that allows you to autofill passwords on your phone, so you rarely ever have to manually copy/paste anything. 

### Statsify

Shameless plug: Statsify is a web app that allows you to visualize various stats and info about a website. Download the extension [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/statsify/nmifmhiilofkndfejgeigkkpmkmlgoeb?hl=en-US&gl=US), visit the website at [https://statsify.us](https://statsify.us), and learn more about the development process [here](/blog/2019-03-03/my-experience-launching-statsify/)!
