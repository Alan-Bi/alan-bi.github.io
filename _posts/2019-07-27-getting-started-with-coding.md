Following up with my latest post on ways to learn coding, in this article, I present some tangible pieces of knowledge that I think are good to know and would give you an edge up as a beginner programmer. 

The topics I will cover include programming languages, text editors and IDEs, debuggers, command line, and version control. A lot of these topics can become very complex, but I’ll try to explain them at a basic level where someone with no programming experience can understand, leaving further learning up to the reader. 

One of the first questions that one asks when beginning to learn programming is what language they should start with. At this point, the most common response you’ll get is that it doesn’t matter. There are many reasons for this. One is that most languages aren’t inherently better or worse than others; each has pros and cons, but choosing a language generally won’t limit the type of programs you can create with it (e.g. Python can be used for web development, data visualization, scripting, etc.). Another is that after learning the fundamentals of computing in one language, switching to another is as simple as memorizing a slightly different set of syntax. For example, after learning French, it’s not too difficult to learn Spanish, as both languages share some common rules and practices. 

Nevertheless, below I’ve listed details about several popular languages and the use cases of each: 

Java: java is the chosen language for AP Computer Science taught in high schools and often used in intro college classes as well. Its frequently used for web development. 

Python: generally regarded as a good beginner language due to its simple syntax. Can be used in areas such as data visualization/science and web development. 

C/C++: two “low-level” languages in that they’re useful for creating things like compilers? or programs that require speed and precision 

JavaScript: despite its name, it’s not at all related to Java. It’s run in web browsers (e.g. Chrome) and is used in a huge number of websites on the front end (whereas languages like Java and Python would be considered backend languages, being run on a server) 

Once you pick a language, it’s time to start coding. To code, you most likely need to use a text editor or IDE (integrated development environment). 

You can think of text editors as Word or Google Docs for code, usually providing useful tools like syntax highlighting or code completion. Most of these are programs you download onto your computer (some come with a default text editor, like NotePad++ on Windows), but you can also find websites that let you write and edit code online. Popular text editors include Sublime Text and Visual Studio Code. 

IDEs are just like text editors but typically heavier duty. XCode, IntelliJ, Visual Studio (not to be confused with Visual Studio Code), and Eclipse are all popular IDEs. They contain advanced features, most importantly debugger functionality.
